In statistical terms, the set of all these voting residents is called a **population**.

We can draw as many samples as we want from a population, and we can even dictate the **size** of the samples, i.e. the *number of members in the sample*.\n",

In the case of the diagram above, we have a population of size $N=18$, with two samples of size $n_1=3$ and $n_2=2$ respectively."

    "## Sampling Frames and Sampling Units\n",
    "As we saw in the section on populations, a population needs to be defined such that it covers the entirety of data that is of interest in a given study. This raises the question of *how* we can identify each individual member of our population to facilitate drawing samples. To this extent, we would like to define a **sampling frame**, i.e. a *list* of all the members in the population for us to sample from. We will use this sampling frame as a basis to draw samples using one or more prescribed methods (sampling methodologies) to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can very well deduce, it may not always be possible to get an entire list of the members in a population. In cases such as these, we strive to define a sampling frame that is **as close as possible** to the population in order to **minimize** bias. Looking back at our motivational example, the sampling frame here would be the *roster of registered voters* in the state!\n",

    "| Samples        | Customers who you contact and actually respond to your survey         |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a sampling frame, we also wish to define the number of members we select at a single time when we draw our samples. This selection size is called the **sampling unit**. Sampling units come in handy when we wish to widen/narrow our scope without altering our entire sampling methodology."

    "Cluster sampling is similar to stratified sampling in the sense that the sampling is done over sub-populations. The main difference however, is that instead of randomly sampling **within** each sub-population with the intention of preserving proportionality, we **randomly select** a **chosen number** of sub-populations and then proceed to sample from the selected sub-populations. If *all* elements in a chosen cluster are sampled, we call the process **one-stage cluster sampling**.\n",

    "<img src='../images/Cluster_Sampling.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, we see that 3 random sub-populations (clusters) were chosen from the 7 that exist in the population. Though the number of clusters chosen is entirely up to the researcher, they are commonly dictated by resource availability (cost, manpower, etc.)"

    "#### Systematic Sampling (create a pool of all entries in population, then count the nth element ikut pre-determined sequence)\n",
    "Systematic sampling is carried out by randomly selecting an initial member of the population from the sampling frame and selecting additional members following a **pre-determined sequence**. This sequence is in the form of the index number for a member incremented/decremented by a fixed step size $h$. For example, if **we start with the 5th member of the population and set a step size of $h = 2$, we will then select the 7th, 9th, 11th (so on and so forth) members of the population until we obtain a sample of desired size**. Note that we can use modulo arithmetic to ensure that we don't overshoot the sample size when counting the indices.\n",

    "Recall the previous example where we wanted to study the the job satisfaction of teachers in international schools in KL. To obtain a systematic sample, we index the list of teachers and pick an random number (e.g. 45) as our starting index. If we want to select 100 members with the step size being $h = 10$, then we select the 45th, 55th, 65th, ..., 445th members as our sample.\n",

    "Systematic sampling is generally favored when the population is known to be large as it is easier to collect one large systematic sample than to draw multiple simple random samples. The conveniece however does come at the cost of bias if the data is ordered, e.g. picking 10 members from a set of 1,000 exam scores sorted in descending order will give a sample with a high average score if the step size is too small.\n",

    "Non-probabilistic sampling is a sampling technique in which the likelihood of a member of a population being selected for a sample is not entirely up to chance. Though easier to execute, we generally avoid non-probabilistic sampling as it yields significant **bias** compared to probabilistic methods. More often than not, non-probabilstic sampling involves sample selections that are based on the researcher's **subjective judgement**. The following sampling techniques fall under the umbrella of non-probabilistic sampling:\n",
    "1. Convenience sampling\n",
    "2. Volunteer sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other types of non-probabilistic sampling (*purposive*, *quota*, etc.), but we will focus on the above two as they are the most commonly used ones. We will aslo skip the pros and cons of these techniques as they are mostly negative, i.e. yield significant bias and should be avoided as far as possible."

    "### Convenience Sampling (will be selecting with bias)\n",
    "As the name suggests, convenience sampling is the selection of members from a population based on the researcher's **ease of access** to members of the population. The following are examples of convenience sampling:\n",
    "1. A company decides to poll the first 100 customers who send them an email inquiring about their services.\n",
    "2. A marketing firm conducts a survey at a shopping mall nearby their home office.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of the above cases, no care is given to *why* a specific person was polled/surveyed other than the fact that they were easy to contact. It goes without saying that such sampling practices will undoubtedly misrepresent the population being studied."

    "### Volunteer Sampling\n",
    "Volunteer sampling is sampling in which the participants are all **willing volunteers**. This technique can yield significant bias because the sample is *chosen by the volunteers*, not the researcher. Volunteers often have a vested interest in the discussion/topic of study and are keen to share their point of view (this isn't always a good thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that the nature of the bias introduced differs from that of a convenience sample - the respondents here are already 'part of the system' being studied and we can expect their opinions to be skewed in favor of the researcher."
