    "Statistics is the science of **collecting**, **organizing**, **analyzing**, **interpreting**, and **presenting** data. It helps us convert measurements we gather from the world around us into knowledge in a **systematic** manner to ensure both **consistency** and **reproducibility** of results.\n",

    "Our journey begins with the simplest of questions - *\"What would we like to know about a certain group of objects?\"* The objects here can refer to people, animals, buildings, household items, etc. - basically anything that is of interest to us. The grouping of said objects is referred to as a **population**, and our aim is to generalize any results we derive from our investigations to this entire group. Populations are usually defined to encompass the largest possible collection of objects that are of interest in a given study.\n",

    "In most cases, the population is so large that collecting data from the entire group becomes **infeasible** (sometimes impossible). For example, suppose that we are interested in the average price of all the 2-bedroom apartments in KL - this population is so large that we cannot study all of it without expending significant effort. In situations such as these, we **collect** data only from a **subgroup** of the population, which we call a **sample**. Ideally, a sample should represent the population well. For instance, a sample of 2-bedroom apartment prices in KL should include apartments from various municipalities to ensure no one part of the city is **under/over-represented**. Further details on populations and samples will be discussed later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having gathered some data on a problem of interest, our data can then be **organized** easily with the use of spreadsheets or databases. In this course, we will operate on the assumption that the data has been cleaned and organized on flat files (CSV, XLS, etc.) as we wish to *focus on the analysis* of our data and not the logistics behind how we store it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of **analyzing** data is to **explore** it - this involves examining the type of data we've collected, how it behaves, and summarize our findings. This process is called **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and is one of the most crucial steps to understanding our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using said findings, we can employ probability and estimation to make generalizations about the population based on our sample. This process is called **inference**, and it represents the culmination of the analysis stage. Inference allows us to use the data collected via a sample to model the behavior of the entire population, e.g. using customer product reviews to determine what product features are in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, we **interpret** and **present** our data with appropriate visual aids. Interpretation often calls for domain-specific knowledge, which is subject to the context of our study. As always, it is best to let the data do the talking and that's precisely where **visualization** comes in.\n",

    "The diagram below gives an overview of what is commonly known as **the big picture** of statistics. It represents the 3 core processes, which are producing/procuring data, exploratory analysis, and inference.

    "One of the core skills in exploratory data analysis is examining the relationships between variables in a data set. In many cases, we wish to establish a basis for cause and effect that can be further investigated. By examining the relationship between variables we can develop a clearer understanding of how one affects the other, allowing us to narrow down on interesting portions of our data.\n",

    "A **multibar chart** is a paired bar chart where one variable is used as the x-axis, and the other is overlaid as categories spanning the first variable. This can be done using the `plot.bar()` method on the resulting DataFrame from `pd.crosstab()` or from the normalized version of `pd.crosstab()` if you prefer to compare percentages instead of the row numbers."

    "We see that as the reading scores go higher, so do the math scores. This makes sense - a student who's poorer at reading may not be able to understand the exam questions, translating to a lower math score. We don't have enough information to verify this theory just yet, but examining the relationship using a scatter plot has given us some insight into how the two are related!\n",

    "When describing the distribution of a single quantitative variable with a histogram, we describe the overall pattern of the distribution (shape, center, spread) and any deviations from that pattern (outliers). The scatter plot here does the same thing, albeit with 2 variables. Two important pieces of information that the scatter plot gives us is the nature (linear/non-linear) of relationship and its direction (positive/negative).\n",

    "A relationship between two variables is classified as **linear** if the pattern of distribution for our data is centered about a straight line, i.e. we can plot a straight line that cuts through the data such that the points are evenly distributed across the line. If the pattern is distributed along some other form of curve, we say it is **non-linear**. If the points appear to be randomly strewn across the plot, we say that no relationship between the variables exist.\n",

    "On the other hand, the direction of a relationship between two quantitative variables can be **positive** or **negative**. A positive (or **increasing**) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with an increase in the other. A negative (or **decreasing**) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with a decrease in the other. One important thing to note here is that not all relationships can be classified as either positive or negative - you can encounter cases where the values swing back and forth in both directions."
